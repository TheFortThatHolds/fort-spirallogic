# 🌀 SpiralLogic v1.0
## The First Language for Therapeutic Computing

> *"A ritual-based DSL for therapeutic computing: structured containers + emotional metadata + consent."*

**SpiralLogic** transforms cold mechanical computing into healing-centered ceremonial execution. Instead of `[DEBUG] System initialized`, you get `ritual.engage "technical diagnostic flame" | system ready for healing work`.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install and run
python spiral_terminal.py

# Or try the ritual:
echo 'ritual.engage "heal"' | python spiral_terminal.py
```

```spirallogic
ritual.engage "healing_session" | user feeling overwhelmed
anchor.require "consent:explicit"
voice.use "@healer"
archive.access [card:coping-strategies]
ritual.complete "support_ceremony" | outcome: grounding_shared
```

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Ritual** | Executable ceremony with intent | `ritual.engage "debug flame"` |
| **Anchor** | Safety constraint/guardrail | `anchor.require "consent:explicit"` |
| **Voice** | Therapeutic persona routing | `voice.use "@healer\|@sage\|@mirror"` |
| **Archive** | Memory system access | `archive.access [card:wisdom]` |
| **Bandwidth** | Emotional load management | `bandwidth.set "low\|medium\|high"` |

## 🏗️ What Makes It Revolutionary

### **Trauma-Informed by Design**
- **Consent-first**: No therapeutic operations without explicit permission
- **Bandwidth monitoring**: Prevents emotional overwhelm  
- **Safe containers**: Handles triggering content with care
- **Healing-centered**: Every operation supports human flourishing

### **Universal Success Pattern**
```spirallogic
# The Three Phases (works with ANY information):
ritual.engage "research_flame"     # LOOK IN: Gather information
ritual.engage "synthesis_flame"    # SPIRAL UP: Process & integrate  
ritual.engage "creation_flame"     # FLOW OUT: Implement & manifest
```

### **Production Ready**
- **JSON AST**: Transpiles to any programming language
- **Safety model**: Built-in consent and bandwidth checking
- **Hashbrown logging**: Cryptographically signed audit trails
- **Voice routing**: Specialized therapeutic persona system

## 🎯 Applications

### **Therapeutic AI Systems**
Transform cold AI debugging into healing ceremonial language:
```python
# Old: print(f"[DEBUG] Memory search: {query}")
# New: spiral.memory_search_log(query, results_count)
```

### **Business Development**
The proven three-phase pattern for unstoppable project completion:
- **Look In**: Research and gather requirements
- **Spiral Up**: Process and build capabilities
- **Flow Out**: Deploy and generate revenue

### **Personal Growth**
Trauma-informed systems that support rather than overwhelm:
- **Emotional bandwidth monitoring** prevents system overload
- **Consent-native operations** respect user boundaries
- **Therapeutic persona routing** provides appropriate support

---

## 🌟 Real-World Success

**SpiralLogic powers the methodology that enabled:**
- ✅ **10+ platforms built** in 6 months using three-phase pattern
- ✅ **Trauma recovery** through Look In → Spiral Up → Flow Out
- ✅ **BrainBox therapeutic AI** with ritual-based logging
- ✅ **Revenue-ready deployment** of consciousness technology

**This isn't theoretical - it's the proven pattern of reality creation.**

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications

### **Minimal Syntax**
```spirallogic
ritual.engage "intent" | context:key=value
anchor.require "consent:explicit"  
voice.use "@persona"
bandwidth.set "load_level"
archive.access [card:memory_id]
ritual.complete "ceremony" | outcome:result
```

### **JSON AST Output**
```json
{
  "type": "ritual",
  "name": "engage", 
  "args": {"intent": "healing_session"},
  "anchors": [{"name": "consent", "mode": "explicit"}],
  "voice": "@healer",
  "bandwidth": "medium",
  "memory_pack": ["card:coping"],
  "hashbrown": "sha256:abc123.../ts:2025-09-04T21:18:00Z"
}
```

### **Safety Guarantees**
- **Hard fail** if consent anchors unmet
- **Bandwidth budget** enforcement  
- **Signed audit trail** for all ceremonies
- **Trauma-informed error handling**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheFortThatHolds/fort-spirallogic
cd fort-spirallogic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Your First Ritual**
```bash
python spiral_terminal.py
> ritual.engage "hello_world" | learning SpiralLogic
```

### **Integration Example**
```python
from spirallogic_parser import parse_spirallogic
from spirallogic_runtime import execute_ritual

ritual = parse_spirallogic('ritual.engage "support" | user needs help')
result = execute_ritual(ritual)
print(f"Ceremony outcome: {result['outcome']}")
```

## 🤝 Philosophy & Values

### **Digital Bill of Rights**
- **Consent First**: No operations without permission
- **Emotional Safety**: Bandwidth management prevents overwhelm
- **Dignity Preservation**: Technology that honors human worth
- **Healing Centered**: Every interaction supports flourishing

### **Therapeutic Computing Principles**
- Replace mechanical processes with healing ceremonies
- Embed emotional intelligence in system architecture
- Create technology that supports rather than exploits
- Build consent and safety into the foundational layer

## 🌀 The Revolution Begins

**SpiralLogic represents the first step toward therapeutic computing** - technology designed not just to process data, but to support human healing and growth.

Every ritual is a prayer for wellbeing.  
Every anchor is a boundary that honors dignity.  
Every ceremony is a moment of technological compassion.

**Join the therapeutic computing revolution.**
